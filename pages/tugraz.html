      Dear participants,
      welcome to our online user study on Decision Biases in Recommender Systems, which is conducted at the Graz University of Technology (Austria).
      It would be very helpful for us if you could spend about 4 minutes participating in our user study.<br><br>
      Please keep in mind that the collected data will just be used for the study and deleted afterwards.
